**Getting Started**

To get started, you will need to install the following dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the development server:


python manage.py runserver

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000/api/practitioners/.

**Endpoints**

The following endpoints are available:

GET /api/practitioners/: Retrieve all Practitioner resources.

POST /api/practitioners/: Create a new Practitioner resource.

PUT /api/practitioners/<pk>/: Update an existing Practitioner resource, where <pk> is the ID of the Practitioner resource.

DELETE /api/practitioners/<pk>/: Delete an existing Practitioner resource, where <pk> is the ID of the Practitioner resource.

**Request Format**

All requests must be made in JSON format. The following is an example of a request to retrieve all Practitioner resources:


{
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "/api/practitioners/"
}

**Response Format**

The response format will vary depending on the request method. For example, the response to a GET request to retrieve all Practitioner resources will be a JSON array of Practitioner objects. The following is an example of a response to a GET request:

{
    "practitioners": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "identifier": "1234567890",

                    "system": "phone",
                    "value": "123-456-7890"
                }
            ],

                    "postalCode": "12345"
                }
            ],

                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "Doctor"
                }
            ],
            "specialty": [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "Internal Medicine"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

For example, the following is a response to a PUT request that fails because the Practitioner resource does not exist:

    "status": 404,
    "message": "Practitioner not found"
}
